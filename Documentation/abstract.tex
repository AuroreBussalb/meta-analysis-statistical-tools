% Abstract

\begin{abstract}

\noindent Neurofeedback is a noninvasive technique that aims to reduce the ADHD symptoms. Given the impact of meta-analysis on that subject,
we first proposed to replicate and update Cortese et al.'s work. Then, we tried to identify factors with an influence on Neurofeedback 
based on the heterogeneity of studies using three multivariate approaches which associated factors with the within subject effect size.
The replication and update of the latest meta-analysis confirm the results obtained by the authors: effect sizes are not significant when 
probably blind ratings are the outcome whereas they are for most proximal raters. Analysis of factors identify 3 elements which may have an impact on Neurofeedback efficacy:
the length of the treatment, the quality of the acquisition of the signals and the person assessing the evolution of the symptoms. Besides these results, we introduce here
a new way to look into the heterogeneity of clinical trials.
