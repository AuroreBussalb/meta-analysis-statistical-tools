% Abstract

\begin{abstract}

\noindent Neurofeedback is a noninvasive technique that aims to reduce the ADHD symptoms. Because of the publication of new researches 
meeting the inclusion criteria of the latest meta-analysis on that subject, we decided to update it. Then, we extended the analysis 
with a novel method: the systematic analysis of biases (SAOB) that takes advantage of studies technical and methodological high heterogeneity 
rather than suffering from it. The update of the most recent meta-analysis confirms the results obtained by its authors: effect sizes are not significant when 
probably blind ratings are the outcome whereas they are for most proximal raters. The SAOB identifies 3 elements that may have 
an impact on Neurofeedback efficacy: the length of the treatment, the quality of the acquisition of the signals and the person assessing 
the evolution of the symptoms. Besides these results, we introduce here a new way to look into the heterogeneity of clinical trials.
