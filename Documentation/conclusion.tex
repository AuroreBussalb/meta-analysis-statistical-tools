\section{Conclusion}

This work offers an open source tool for running meta-analysis and \gls{saob}: the code and data used are available, 
assuring the transparency and replicability of these analysis. 

The results of the first part of the work confirm \citet{Cortese2016}'findings in the light of recent published clinical work.

We propose here a new method for tackling the heterogeneity of clinical data on \gls{nfb}.

Among the factors identified as positively contributing to \gls{nfb} efficacy, one of them is linked to the quality
of acquisition of the \gls{eeg}. This result indirectly confirms a mode of action through specific \gls{eeg} training.
Likewise, treatment intensity corroborates what is known of learning theory (memory consolidation) and indirectly validates it as
part of the mode of action.

These elements converge to the conclusion that existing methodologies traditionally used to assess pills are not adapted to the evaluation 
of medical devices.

Consequently, \gls{nfb} is probably efficacious and the risk/benefit ratio is certainly in favor of its use as the clinical evidence stands today.
