	(last searched on August 30, 2015), b) studies satisfying \citet{Cortese2016}'s criteria (last searched on February 12, 2018), c) studies 
	satisfying \citet{Cortese2016} criteria to the exception of the part relative to the control group (last searched on February 12, 2018).}

  \caption{Comparison between \citet{Cortese2016} results obtained with RevMan \citep{RevMan} and those obtained with the meta-analysis package with our 
	choices$^a$ applied. \glsentryfirstplural{se} (\glspl{se}) and their corresponding p-value (in parenthesis) are presented. With the meta-analysis package, a negative \gls{se}
	is in favor of \glsfirst{nfb} unlike \citeauthor{Cortese2016}.}

	\item $^a$ Post-test values for \citeauthor{Arnold2014} are obtained after 40 sessions of \gls{nfb} and Conners scale is used for \citeauthor{Steiner2014}
	teachers' outcomes.

  \caption{Results of the \glsfirst{wls}, \gls{lasso} and decision tree. For the \gls{wls}, a p-value $<$ 0.05 (in bold) means that the coefficient of 
	the corresponding factor is significantly different from 0. For the \gls{lasso}, factors not set to 0 (in bold) are selected. For the decision tree,
	the place of the factor in the tree is indicated. For the first two columns, when the value of the coefficient is negative, the corresponding factor may lead to better \glsfirst{nfb} results.}
