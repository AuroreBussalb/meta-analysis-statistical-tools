\section{Introduction} 

\gls{adhd} is a common child psychiatric disorder characterized by impaired attention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity, 
symptoms that may persist in adulthood with clinical significance, which makes \gls{adhd} a life-long problem for many patients 
\citep{Faraone2006}. The prevalence of \gls{adhd} is about 5\% in school-aged children yielding to an estimated 2.5 millions of 
children in Europe \citep{DSM-5}. \gls{adhd} has an impact on the children well being because many of them may have low self 
esteem \citep{Shaw2005} and underachieve at school \citep{Barry2002} but parents are also affected by this situation \citep{Harpin2005}.
Besides \gls{adhd} has a financial impact: a survey of 2013 in the Netherlands estimated at between 9,860 \euro and 14,483 \euro 
the \gls{adhd} related costs per patient annually \citep{le2014}. 
 
The diagnosis of \gls{adhd} primarily relies on questionnaire-based clinical evaluation \citep{DSM-5}, which can be supported 
with objective assessment metrics of executive function such as the \gls{tova} \citep{Forbes1998}, the \gls{cpt} \citep{Barkley1991} 
and the \gls{sart} \citep{Robertson1997}. At the opposite, objective markers of brain function using \gls{eeg}, \gls{fmri}, or \gls{pet}
could not successfully improve diagnosis (\href{https://shop.nebahealth.com/products/neba-fda-cleared-brainwave-adhd-assessment-aid}{Neba})
at the individual level but proved significantly heterogeneous on the population. More specifically, these studies allowed to identify 
specific neurophysiological phenotypes of \gls{adhd}: this was particularly reported with \gls{eeg} recordings \citep{loo2017}. 
For instance, \gls{adhd} patients were found to show an increase in theta waves (4-8Hz) in the frontal area whereas there are less 
beta waves (12-32Hz) and \gls{smr} (13-15Hz) in the central area \citep{Monastra2005, Matouvsek1984, Janzen1995}.  
 
Among all existing treatments, the most widely used is psychostimulants, which have been proven to be 
efficacious \citep{Taylor2014, Storebo2015}. However, the long-term effects when taking psychostimulants
are not established \citep{DuPaul1998, Swanson2001, Jensen1999}. Moreover, \gls{adhd} children under medication commonly suffer 
from side effects such as loss of appetite and sleep problems but no serious adverse events have been reported \citep{Storebo2015, Cooper2011}. 
These drawbacks make some parents and clinicians reluctant to choose such medications, so they turn to drug-free
treatment options such as dietary changes \citep{Belanger2009} and behavioral therapy, which have been proven in most of cases 
less efficient \citep{Sonuga-Barke2013}.

\gls{nfb} is a noninvasive technique that aims to reduce \gls{adhd} symptoms \citep{Arns2015, Steffert2010, Marzbani2016}.
It is a self-paced brain neuromodulation technique that represents one's brain activity in real-time using auditory or 
visual modulations, on which learning paradigms can be applied such as operant conditioning \citep{Reynolds1975} or voluntary control.
To deliver this intervention, neurophysiological time series must be recorded and analyzed in real-time and implemented in serious games 
leveraging learning paradigms \citep{Wang2010}. To that effect, recorded brain signals are analyzed to extract a real time representations of the activity 
of a population of neurons involved in attentional networks to which learning paradigms are applied, which is translated into a visual 
or auditory cues. The sensory feedback constitutes the rewards mechanism that promotes learning using a well-known operant conditioning protocol \citep{Sherlin2011}. 
The operant conditioning principle will enable the child to repeat more and more easily this task \citep{Skinner1961} and thanks to the natural neuronal plasticity,
a neuronal reorganization is observed \citep{VanDoren2017}. 

In case of \gls{adhd}, several \gls{nfb} protocols have been proposed and investigated to decrease the symptoms: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item protocols based on frequency band training: a child can be asked to enhance his \gls{smr} 
	while suppressing theta or beta \citep{Lubar1976}, or he can have to enhance beta
	while suppressing theta (this scenario is known as \gls{tbr}) \citep{Arns2013};
	\item protocol based on the \glspl{scp} training which consists in the regulation of cortical excitation 
	thresholds by focusing on activity generated by external cues 
	(similar to \glspl{erp}) \citep{Heinrich2004, Banaschewski2007}; 
	\item protocol based on \glspl{erp} (P300) \citep{Fouillen2017}: children have to focus on
	external cues leading to a reduced P300 amplitude so it can be considered as a specific 
	neurophysiological marker of selective attention. 
\end{itemize} 

Shortly after the discovery of the brain's electric activity by \citet{Berger1929}, \citet{Durup1935} proved it could be voluntarily modulated. 
The first indication of its therapeutic potential came forty years later when \citet{Sterman1974} serendipitously found the training of \gls{smr} 
activity to reduce the incidence of epileptic crisis in kerozen-exposed cats. The technique, then known as \gls{nfb} quickly became investigated in 
various fields of neuropsychiatry including, most notably, \gls{adhd} and resulting in a relatively large body of scientific literature 
\citep{Lubar1976, Rossiter1995, Linden1996, Maurizio2014}. Subsequently, its efficacy on the core symptoms of \gls{adhd} (inattention, hyperactivity 
and impulsivity) has been subject to several meta-analytic studies \citep{Loo2005, Lofthouse2012, Arns2009, Micoulaud2014, Sonuga-Barke2013}. 

The most recent meta-analysis solely on the efficacy of \gls{nfb} has been conducted by \citet{Cortese2016} where
13 studies are included. Although only \glspl{rct} were selected, the authors of 
this meta-analysis made some choices that have been debated by the community in particular by 
\citet{Micoulaud2016} who criticized the use of an uncommon behavioral scale provided by \citet{Steiner2014}
for the teachers' assessments and the inclusion of a pilot study carried out by \citet{Arnold2014} in the meta-analysis. 

Because of the publication of new \glspl{rct} meeting \citeauthor{Cortese2016}'s inclusion criteria, it was decided to update his work and take 
the opportunity to investigate some choices that later proved controversial. Eventually, we extended the analysis with a novel method we introduced:
the \gls{saob} that takes advantage of studies technical and methodological high heterogeneity rather than suffering from it. Indeed, the \gls{nfb} 
domain is characterized by a clinical literature that is tremendously heterogeneous: studies differ on a methodological 
point of view (randomization and presence of a blind assessor for instance), but also on the \gls{nfb} implementation (number of sessions,
session and treatment length and type of protocol for instance) and on the acquisition and pre-processing of the \gls{eeg}. Since we supposed that the 
methodological and technical choices made by authors may lead to various \gls{nfb} results, we propose here to identify which of the factors 
independently influence the reported \gls{es} thanks to adequate statistical tools.
