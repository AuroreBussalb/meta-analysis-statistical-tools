\section{Introduction} 

% What is ADHD? What are its consequences?
\gls{adhd} is a common child psychiatric disorder characterized by impaired attention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity.
Symptoms may persist in adulthood with clinical significance, which makes \gls{adhd} a life-long problem for many
patients \citep{Faraone2006}. The prevalence of \gls{adhd} is about 5\% in school-aged children yielding to an estimated
2.5 millions of children in Europe \citep{DSM-5}. \gls{adhd} impacts children's well-being with many of them suffering
from low self esteem \citep{Shaw2005} and underachieving at school \citep{Barry2002}. Parents are equally affected by this
situation since child's behavior is commonly attributed to bad parenting \citep{Harpin2005}. From a societal point
of view, \gls{adhd} has a high financial impact: a survey of 2013 in Europe estimated at between $9,860$ and 
$14,483$ Euros per patient/year the cost related to \gls{adhd} \citep{le2014}. 

% How is it diagnosed?
The diagnosis of \gls{adhd} primarily relies on questionnaire-based clinical evaluation \citep{DSM-5}, which can be
supported with objective assessment metrics of executive function such as the \gls{tova} \citep{Forbes1998}, the
\gls{cpt} \citep{Barkley1991}, and the \gls{sart} \citep{Robertson1997}. Objective markers of brain function
using \gls{eeg}, \gls{fmri}, or \gls{pet} are not considered useful to improve diagnosis at the individual
level \citep{Neba}, but can help differentiating groups of patients \citep{Johnstone2005}.  
In particular, different phenotypes of \gls{adhd} patients present with an increase in the \gls{eeg} theta waves 
power (4-8Hz) and/or a decrease of \gls{eeg} beta waves power (12-32Hz) in frontal areas, or a decrease in the \gls{eeg} 
\gls{smr} power (13-15Hz) in the central area \citep{Monastra2005, Matouvsek1984, Janzen1995, loo2017}.  

% How is it treated? 
Among all existing treatments, the most widely used is psychostimulants, which have been proven to be efficacious
\citep{Taylor2014, Storebo2015}. However, their long-term effectiveness and side effects are still debated and form 
an active area of research \citep{DuPaul1998, Swanson2001, Jensen1999}. Moreover, \gls{adhd} children under medication 
commonly suffer from mild side effects such as loss of appetite and sleep disturbance, however serious adverse events
are rare \citep{Storebo2015, Cooper2011}. These drawbacks make some parents and clinicians reluctant to 
opt for such treatment, turning them to non-pharmaceutical alternatives such as dietary changes \citep{Belanger2009} and behavioral 
therapy, which have been proven to be less efficacious \citep{Sonuga-Barke2013}.

% What is NFB? 
\gls{nfb} is another non-pharmaceutical and non-invasive approach aiming at the reduction of \gls{adhd} symptoms 
\citep{Arns2015, Steffert2010, Marzbani2016}. Shortly after the discovery of the brain's electric activity by 
\citet{Berger1929}, \citet{Durup1935} proved it could be voluntarily modulated leading to a series of finding on the 
self-regulation of brain activity. The first indication of the therapeutic potential of brain activity operant-conditioning 
came forty years later when \citet{Sterman1974} serendipitously found that training the \gls{smr} activity reduces the incidence 
of epileptic crisis in kerozen-exposed cats. The technique, then known as \gls{nfb}, quickly became investigated in various 
fields of neuropsychiatry including, most notably, \gls{adhd} \citep{Lubar1976, Rossiter1995, Linden1996, Maurizio2014}.

Thus, \gls{nfb} is a self-paced brain neuromodulation technique that represents one's brain activity in real-time using auditory 
or visual modulations, on which learning paradigms, such as operant conditioning
\citep{Reynolds1975} or voluntary control, can be applied. To deliver this intervention, neurophysiological time series 
analyzed in real-time so as to be incorporated in feedback applications such as serious games leveraging learning paradigms \citep{Wang2010}. 
These data represent the activity of a population of neurons involved in attentional networks, which is translated into 
visual or auditory cues. The sensory feedback constitutes the rewards mechanism promoting learning using operant conditioning 
protocol \citep{Sherlin2011}. Operant conditioning enables neural plasticity supporting the child in the task repetition \citep{Skinner1961}, 
which is supposed to result in long-lasting neuronal reorganization \citep{VanDoren2017}. 

Several \gls{nfb} protocols have been proposed and investigated to decrease the symptoms of \gls{adhd}:
\begin{itemize} 
  \item protocols based on neural oscillations, using frequency-band power training: enhance \gls{smr} \citep{Beauregard2006}, reduce theta 
	  or enhance beta, or a composite protocol as enhancing beta while suppressing theta, also known as the \gls{tbr}
    protocol \citep{Lubar1976, Arns2013}; 
  \item the protocol based on the \glspl{scp} training consisting in the regulation of
    cortical excitation thresholds by focusing on activity generated by external cues (similar to \glspl{erp})
    \citep{Heinrich2004, Banaschewski2007}; 
  \item the protocol to enhance \glspl{erp}: P300 amplitude can be considered as a specific
    neurophysiological marker of selective attention \citep{Fouillen2017}.  
\end{itemize} 

% Clinical evidence of NFB
\gls{nfb} efficacy on the core symptoms of \gls{adhd} (inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity) has been the 
subject of several meta-analytic studies \citep{Loo2005, Lofthouse2012, Arns2009, Micoulaud2014, Sonuga-Barke2013}. 
\textcolor{red}{These studies don't reach a consensus on the efficacy of \gls{nfb}: although \citet{Arns2009} and \citet{Micoulaud2014} 
find results in favor of its efficacy, especially on the inattention component as highlighted by \citeauthor{Micoulaud2014}, \citet{Loo2005, 
Lofthouse2012, Sonuga-Barke2013} voice their reserves and ask for better evidence from blinded assessment.}

% Position of the problem
\textcolor{red}{The last meta-analysis addressing the efficacy of \gls{nfb} has been published by \citet{Cortese2016}, including a total of 13
\glspl{rct}. The results of this analysis are mixed: when based on parent assessments, which are not blind to treatment, they are significantly 
in favor of \gls{nfb} whereas when the evolution of symptoms is rated by teachers (considered as probably blind), results are no longer 
significant. Thus, the authors called for better evidence from blinded assessments in order to support \gls{nfb} as a treatment for \gls{adhd} symptoms.
However, some choices made in this meta-analysis, which might have an impact on the results, have since been debated by the community}. Specifically, 
\citet{Micoulaud2016} criticized the use of an uncommon behavioral scale provided by \citet{Steiner2014} for the teachers' assessments 
and the inclusion of a pilot study carried out by \citet{Arnold2014}. 

% Work done here
Finally, because of the publication of new \glspl{rct} meeting \citeauthor{Cortese2016}'s inclusion criteria, we
decided to update the meta-analysis and take the opportunity to investigate the impact of the controversial choices.
\textcolor{red}{While performing it, we realized that this approach presents some loopholes: first, assuming that the difference between teacher and parent
assessments can solely be explained by placebo effect; second, pooling together heterogeneous studies in terms of methodology and technical
implementation. An interesting approach, but not commonly performed, to assess the \gls{nfb} efficacy would be to analyze the specificity of the \gls{eeg} changes with respect 
to trained neuromarkers \citep{Maurizio2014}. In our case, based on the data to our disposal, we take advantage of the technical and methodological heterogeneity 
of the \gls{nfb} trials rather than suffering from it, by extending the pressent work with a novel method, the \gls{saob}.} Indeed, the \gls{nfb} domain is 
characterized by a clinical literature that is tremendously heterogeneous: studies differ methodologically (random assignment and 
presence of a blind assessment for instance), in the \gls{nfb} implementation (number of sessions, session and treatment length,
and type of protocol for instance) as well as on the acquisition and processing of the \gls{eeg} signal. \textcolor{red}{Description and analysis of different types 
of \gls{nfb} implementation was subject to several studies \citep{Arns2014, Enriquez2017, Vernon2004, Jeunet2018} but to our knowledge none used statistical 
tools to quantify their influence on clinical endpoints.}

Since methodological and technical implementations of studies are very likely to influence their outcomes \citep{Congedo2004}, we suggest 
here to identify which of the factors independently influence the clinical efficacy with the use of appropriate statistical tools. 
\textcolor{red}{In addition, to all raw data we used, a complete Python library is released for performing meta-analysis, for easing the replication of 
this and previous studies as well as for future projects.}
