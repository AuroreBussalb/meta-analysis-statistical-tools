\section{Results}

\subsection{Selected studies}

Search terms entered in Pubmed returned 152 results during the last check on February 12 2018, including 28 
articles used in previous meta-analyses on \gls{nfb}. After the selection process illustrated 
in Figure~\ref{Figure:systematic_review_workflow}, 32 studies were included in the \gls{saob} and 15 in the meta-analysis 
as summarized in Table~\ref{Table:table_factors_analysis_meta_analysis_list_studies}. The 32 studies selected for the \gls{saob} 
followed the \citeauthor{Cortese2016}'s criteria, with the exception of the requirement for a control group. 
Indeed, since within-\gls{es} were considered in this analysis, a control group was not required.

\subsection{Meta-analysis}

\textcolor{red}{\sout{The Python module developed and used for this work was validated (details available in Supplemental Materials) 
and the code was made available online}} \citep{Bussalb2018}.

The replication and the update of \citeauthor{Cortese2016}'s \textcolor{red}{\sout{study was conducted by applying the choices described 
in the Materials and Methods section and the}} results obtained are presented 
in Table~\ref{Table:meta_review_comparison_revman_and_python_with_choices}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item when computing the between-\gls{es} for \citet{Arnold2014} with the values after 40 sessions of \gls{nfb}, 
      smaller between-\gls{es} were found as compared to those found by \citet{Cortese2016}, \textcolor{red}{which} was unexpected since  
			the clinical efficacy is supposed to increase with the number of \gls{nfb} sessions. \textcolor{red}{These lower between-\gls{es}
			impacted the \gls{se}: they were slightly lower when computed with this choice but they remained significant (see the three first lines 
			of Table~\ref{Table:meta_review_comparison_revman_and_python_with_choices})};  
    \item when relying on the teachers' ratings from the Conners-3 to compute the between-\gls{es} of \citet{Steiner2014}, 
		higher \gls{se} were found in attention but not for total and hyperactivity score. However, this different choice of 
		scale did not affect the statistical significance of the \glspl{se} \textcolor{red}{(see the three first lines 
			of Table~\ref{Table:meta_review_comparison_revman_and_python_with_choices})}.
\end{itemize}

The meta-analysis was then extended by adding two new articles \citep{Strehl2017, Baumeister2016} \textcolor{red}{\sout{found 
by applying the same search criteria and finding more recent matches}}. \citet{Baumeister2016} provided results 
only for parents total outcome whereas \citet{Strehl2017} gave teachers and parents' assessments for all outcomes. 
Despite favorable results for \gls{nfb}, particularly on parents' assessments, adding these two new studies did not 
change neither the magnitude nor the significance of the \gls{se}, for any outcome regardless the raters,
as illustrated in Figure~\ref{Figure:meta_review_forest_plots_update_meta_analysis_our_choices_no_colors_2-columns_fitting_image}. 
 
\textcolor{red}{\sout{As initially suggested by }}\citeauthor{Cortese2016}\textcolor{red}{\sout{, the analysis was ran on two subgroups of studies: one gathering 
studies following the standard protocol defined by }} \citet{Arns2014} \textcolor{red}{\sout{and a second including only participants not taking medications 
during the clinical trial. }}

Regarding the "standard protocol" subgroup, \citet{Cortese2016} found all the outcomes significant except for the 
hyperactivity symptoms rated by teachers, which only showed a statistical trend (p-value = 0.11). Similar results 
were obtained when adding the most recent studies meeting this definition \citep{Strehl2017} (p-value = 0.11). 
The \gls{se} for the total outcome assessed by teachers remained significant with the addition of the two new
\glspl{rct} (p-value = 0.043), giving more power to this result since it is now based on four studies including 283
patients in total.

As for the no-drug subgroup, \glspl{se} were found significant for the inattention symptoms assessed by parents (p-value = 0.013). 
Besides, the differences in \citet{Arnold2014} values caused a loss of significance in hyperactivity outcome for parents 
(p-value = 0.066) compared to \citet{Cortese2016} (p-value = 0.016). The two new studies were not included in this 
subgroup because subjects were taking psychostimulants during the trial.

All the clinical scales used to compute the between-\gls{es} following our choices are summarized in the Supplemental Materials.

\subsection{Factors influencing Neurofeedback}

This analysis was performed on 32 trials assessing the efficacy of \gls{nfb} as presented 
in Table~\ref{Table:table_factors_analysis_meta_analysis_list_studies}. Among the 25 factors selected, six were 
removed because there were too many missing observations or because they were too homogeneous: beta up in frontal areas, 
the use of a transfer card, the type of threshold for the rewards (incremental or fixed), the EEG quality equal of 3
\textcolor{red}{\sout{(meaning that the electrodes used were either \gls{agcl}/Gel or \gls{au}/Gel, a check of electrode contact quality was
performed, and the hardware used was CE marked)}}, and the presence of a control group. 

All results are presented in Table~\ref{Table:table_factors_analysis_results_summary}. These results require a 
careful interpretation since each technique provided with slightly different results. These differences 
may depend on the different assumptions of the model and several other factors. In any case, we are inclined to 
trust those findings that are consistent across methods. 

The \gls{wls} technique identified six significant factors for an adjusted R-squared of 0.62 \textcolor{red}{(see second column of 
Table~\ref{Table:table_factors_analysis_results_summary})}. 
When applying the \gls{ols}, the same factors were significant except the session pace with a lower adjusted R-squared 
(0.33). The \gls{lasso} regression selected 9 significant factors \textcolor{red}{(see third column of 
Table~\ref{Table:table_factors_analysis_results_summary})}. With these methods, a negative coefficient means 
that the factor is in favor of the efficacy of \gls{nfb}. The decision tree is presented in Figure~\ref{Figure:factors_analysis_decision_tree_results}: 
the best predictor in our case was the \gls{pblind} \textcolor{red}{(see last column of 
Table~\ref{Table:table_factors_analysis_results_summary})}. Five other factors also split the subsets, however, 
the lower we get into the tree, the less samples are available, making the interpretation more and more doubtful.  

Several factors were common to the three methods used. In particular: the assessment 
by a blind rater, the treatment length, and an \gls{eeg} quality score equal to 2 \textcolor{red}{(see lines 6, 14, and 24 of 
Table~\ref{Table:table_factors_analysis_results_summary})}\textcolor{red}{\sout{(meaning that at least one of the three quality criteria had to be fulfilled)}}.
The methods also agreed on the direction of the effect for these factors: 
a shorter treatment and recording the \gls{eeg} with a good-quality system seems preferable, whereas teachers' assessment appears less favorable
as compared to parents' assessment.

It is more doubtful the influence of the factors returned by only one or two methods \textcolor{red}{(see lines 1, 7, 8, 13, 16, 17, 21, and 22 
of Table~\ref{Table:table_factors_analysis_results_summary})}. In particular: 
both \gls{wls} and \gls{lasso} found that including a transfer phase seems not to improve \gls{adhd} symptoms. 
Conversely, the \gls{irb} approval and a higher number of sessions per week appears to positively influence the efficacy of the \gls{nfb} treatment. 
Five factors were returned by only one of the methods: the correction of ocular artifacts, the session length, the \gls{smr} protocol, 
randomizing the groups and the presence of more than one active electrode.  

Eight factors were never selected by the three methods \textcolor{red}{(see lines 3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 18, 19 and 20 of 
Table~\ref{Table:table_factors_analysis_results_summary})}: the artifact correction based on amplitude, the children minimum and maximum age, 
being on drugs during \gls{nfb} treatment, the number of sessions, and the protocols beta up in central areas, theta down, and \gls{scp}. 
Thus, these factors definitely appear not to have an influence on \gls{nfb} efficacy.  

In the next section we discuss only the factors that were selected by at least two of the three methods.
