\section{Conclusion}


This work confirms \citet{Cortese2016}'s findings in the light of recent published clinical work.
In particular, studies following a standard protocol as defined by \citet{Arns2014} show significant clinical  improvements on \gls{pblind}
raters (k = 4 studies instead of 3 \citet{Cortese2016}).

Besides this meta-analysis, a new method is suggested to tackle the high heterogeneity of clinical data available on \gls{nfb}. This method aims at identifying factors as positively or negatively contributing to \gls{nfb} efficacy. 
Three factors were consistently found to statistically significantly explain clinical withing-\gls{es}.
First, the quality of acquisition of the \gls{eeg} was positively correlated with clinical efficacy. It confirms a mode of action through specific \gls{eeg} training.
Likewise, treatment intensity was found to contribute, corroborating what is known of learning theory (memory consolidation) \citep{Mowrer1960}, that is a more intense treatment leads to an increased clinical efficacy. Finaly,  results show that the therapeutic efficacy measured by teachers is reduced compared to  that measured by parents.
This result has long been document and it is widely accepted that this difference is solely imputable to the amplitude of placebo effect in \gls{nfb}. However, the data presented in this article tend to refute this hypothesis and suggest that teachers are simply exposed to less symptoms, in line with the most recent work on the topic. 
As a consequence, using \gls{pblind} endpoints to address the specificity of the clinical efficacy is not recommended and the community shoud instead rely on other available methodological tools. Those include  sham neurofeedback and neuromarker analysis investigating the specificity of the \gls{eeg} changes with respect to trained neuromarkers and changes in clinical endpoints.

These elements converge to the conclusion that existing methodologies traditionally used to assess druf treatments in neuropsychiatric conditions may not be fully fit to the evaluation of medical devices. The series of results presented here however suggest the presence of a genuine signal in favor of the therapeutic efficacy of \gls{nfb}. A signal that should nonetheless be strengthen using the aforementioned methodological tools, neuromarker analysis in the first place.

This work also offers an open source tool for running meta-analysis and \gls{saob}: the code and data used are available, assuring the transparency and replicability of these analysis.
